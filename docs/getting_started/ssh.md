# SSH Keys

Access to ilifu is controlled through ssh public-private key pairs.

If you are a new user you have likely just generated a ssh key pair, and sent your public key to our system through the webform.

In the event that you lose your ssh key pair, you can generate a new key pair by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/). If you have lost your ssh key pair you will receive an error `Permission denied (publickey)` when trying to access the ilifu system via ssh. In this event, please generate a new ssh key pair and contact support@ilifu.ac.za, providing your new public key. **Do not send your private key.**

## Updating a current key pair or adding a new key pair

If you would like to update your existing ssh key pair, or add to your current key pairs, you can submit a request to support@ilifu.ac.za containing the new SSH key and instructions to either replace your current key pair with the new one, or add to your existing key pair(s). Note that you may have multiple key pairs corresponding to different devices, e.g., laptop, office desktop, or home desktop. We may, however, ask for a reason for adding a new key pair if your account already has several keys associated with it.
