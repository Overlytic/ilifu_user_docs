# SSH Keys

Access to ilifu is controlled through SSH public-private key pairs.

If you are a new user, you have likely just generated an SSH key pair, and sent your public key to our system through the webform.

## Managing your SSH public key

You are able to manage the SSH public keys associated with your ilifu account by using the [SSH key managment](https://usage.ilifu.ac.za/ssh_keys) service. Use this service if you would like to update your existing SSH key, or add to your current key(s). Note that you may have multiple keys corresponding to different devices, e.g., laptop, office desktop, or home desktop.

## Generating a new SSH key pair

In the event that you lose your SSH key pair, you can generate a new key pair by following these [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/). If you have lost your SSH key pair you will receive an error `Permission denied (publickey)` when trying to access the ilifu system via SSH. In this event, please generate a new SSH key pair and update the SSH public key associated with your ilifu profile using the [SSH key managment](https://usage.ilifu.ac.za/ssh_keys) service.
