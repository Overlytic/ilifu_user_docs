# Getting Help

## Ilifu support

If you have any queries about the ilifu cloud service facility or if you need any help with using the services, please contact us at support@ilifu.ac.za. If you are writing about specific problems you are having running jobs, then it can be very helpful, when possible, if you provide the following information:
1. Please include a job id.
2. Please include output from your job's log file(s), or from the job's stdout/stderr files. If these are large, it can be useful to go through them yourself and find any relevant parts.
